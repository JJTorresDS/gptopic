This is the worst option you could choose, I would recommend staying away from it unless you want to lose money and get stressed. The recommended way, \"Instant Deposit\", locks your account for external transfers for 7 BUSINESS days, with no warning at all. I used it, bought coins, tried to transfer them and found out I'm locked. If I want to sell the coins or swap to another, it'll eat 12%, so its not worth it.\n",
